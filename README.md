# collectivepsypatology
first of all, it is a village project where patients with schizophrenia and similar patients who have lost their functionality in this village and have weakened in human relations will be constantly active. For example, every morning when these people wake up in the morning, there will be a village where they will start the day with good morning meetings, then chat with other people, then play a game made on the erc 721 network and earn etherium tokens again and continuously increase their functionality. Apart from these patients, there will be only psychologists and therapists in this village. Of course, this requires funds and capital. However, in the village system to be established, an ecosystem will be formed that will be sufficient for both psychosis patients, psychologists and therapists, and most importantly, you, the founder.
 Those who want to cooperate as the owner of the project idea, please contact.
